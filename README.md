It was the homework in Vancouver college.
The goal is to going to the lower right from the higher left.  


An inaccessbile block is ramdomly set per line.  
Player can reset the game with pressing g if it can't be finished.

When beating, you watch the message, "Game clear!! Congratulation!!".
Then, the game window will be automatically closed.
